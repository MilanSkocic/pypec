pypec 0.1 Release Notes
=========================================


Highlights
-----------------
pypec aims at fitting PEC data with an graphical interface. 
The program was initially developped in Python 2.7 during my PhD from 2012 to 2015. 

In 2016, the code was rewritten in Python 3 at the end of my PhD with slight modifications of the original code. 
The code remained untouched for almost 3 years and is now again under development in this repository.

This is the first release after migrating to github which will serve as a backup for the version developed during my
PhD with completed documentation. No modification to the original code.


New Features
-----------------

* Load data: \*.dot files (data format developped in Grenoble Lab SiMaP)
* multi-process fitting: N processes x M fits x L loops
* automatic creation of result folder based on sample name and fitting parameters
* results saved in a folder
