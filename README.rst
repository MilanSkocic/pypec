Description
================

PyPEC aims at Fitting PEC data with an graphical interface. 
The program was initially developped in Python 2.7 during my PhD from 2012 to 2015 and the code is available on github
`PyPEC (Python 2) <https://github.com/MilanSkocic/PyPEC>`_. 

In 2016, the code was rewritten in Python 3 at the end of my PhD with slight modifications of the original. The code 
remained untouched for almost 3 years and is now again under development in this repository.

This is the first release after migrating to github which will serve as a backup for the version developed during my
PhD with completed documentation.
